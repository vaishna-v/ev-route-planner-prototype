# EV Route Planner - Prototype

This project is a **prototype GUI for EV Route Planning**, created for our **DSA Project Based Learning (PBL)**.

⚠️ **Note:**  
This version was generated with the help of AI tools and serves only as a **reference** for our final implementation.  
The actual backend (in C) and final algorithms will be built by our team.

## Features (Prototype)
- Basic GUI built in Python (Tkinter + matplotlib + networkx).
- Loads a sample graph from JSON.
- Sidebar for route input (non-functional yet).
- Clickable buttons for algorithm, edit, load, save (placeholders).

## Final Project (Planned)
- Graph algorithms in C (Dijkstra, A*, Bellman-Ford, etc.).
- EV-specific constraints (battery, charging stations).
- Integration of backend (C) with GUI frontend.
